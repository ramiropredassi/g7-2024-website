### Driven to understand if our friendship story was unique, we found it interesting **to explore whether football is an element of union or division.** 

Moved to nourish our understanding, we found something amazing: two concepts are associated with this issue in the literature!
  - Ingroup **[intergroup]**
  - Outgroup **[‚Äòoutside the group‚Äô](#footnote)**


>We saw that these two concepts have something in common: <br>**_IT IS ALL ABOUT GROUPS!_**
><br>Despite being fans of different football clubs we are not lonely watchers: **_Groups, or communities, are what ties everything together!_**

## Why football? Besides our passion for this sport, this is also the most popular sport today!
With its 5 billion fans around the world (FIFA 2021), football has become a true social phenomenon that can be studied from different points of view. This discipline can also analyse different aspects of society.

Even if we want to explore what happens in each club, country, and continent, limiting our initial search to two cases, Italy üáÆüáπ and Argentina üá¶üá∑, is pertinent.
<br>Not only do we love ‚ù§Ô∏è these countries' football clubs, but they are nations that share a common history despite being separated by the ocean.

<br>Italians and Argentinians are passionate about football 
Both countries also share common historical roots, and there are numerous examples of players who connect both football realities!.
