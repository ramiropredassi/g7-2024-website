Through football, various topics are studied such as politics, culture, economics, psychology, tourism, and more. Football allows the examination of multiple aspects of society, such as inclusion, brotherhood, and team spirit (Halldorsson 2018), but also division, rivalry, and violence (Newson 2019).

# Why the Comparison Between Italy and Argentina?

It is estimated that between 1870 and 1960, over 2 million Italian citizens moved to Argentina. Many Argentine politicians, actors, models, and several sports figures have Italian origins. River Plate, one of the most representative teams in Argentina alongside Boca Juniors, owes its origin to a group of Genoese boys who arrived in Buenos Aires seeking fortune.
