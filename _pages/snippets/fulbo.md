### Driven to understand if our friendship story was unique, we found it interesting **to explore whether football is an element of union or division.** 

Moved to nourish our understanding, we found something amazing: two concepts are associated with this issue in the literature!
  - Ingroup **[intergroup]**
  - Outgroup **[‘outside the group’]**

>We saw that these two concepts have something in common: **_IT IS ALL ABOUT GROUPS!_**
><br>Although we are fans of different football clubs, we share another thing: **_we are not lonely watchers!_**
