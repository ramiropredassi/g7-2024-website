>- Do you also watch football in the company of other fanatics?
>- Have you ever felt that strangers could become close friends after watching a match?
>- Have you cried or celebrated the result of your football team in the presence of other people?
>- Do you enjoy chatting and sharing your opinions during a game?
>- We all love to do that, so we used to watch our favourite matches in a pub!

- The new technologies have contributed to bringing these experiences to the comfort of your home!
- Twitch is an interactive streaming service that, in addition to exploring opinion threads, allows us to capture user interactions â€“ even if people are in different parts of the world!
  - Encouraged to understand if football is an element of union or division, we found it interesting to explore how communities grew up on Twitch, how they interact, and how they influence each other.
- Why football? Besides our passion for this sport, this is also the most popular sport today!
- With its 5 billion fans around the world (FIFA 2021), football has become a true social phenomenon that can be studied from different points of view. This discipline can also analyse different aspects of society.
- Even if we want to explore what happens in each club, country, and continent, limiting our initial search to two cases, Italy and Argentina, is pertinent.
- Not only do we love these countries' football clubs, but they are nations that share a common history despite being separated by the ocean. Italians and Argentinians are passionate about football [see if they are indicators]. Both countries also share common historical roots, and there are numerous examples of players who connect both football realities!
- Although they share a similar football history, Twitch dynamics are not the same in both countries, and we also found it interesting to capture this difference.
- In Argentina, there are two main channels with ***(number) users; in Italy, there are many more, so we used Twitchmetrics to select the most popular based on the number of views!
  - ![BAR CHART](path/to/bar-chart.png)
- Although the Atlantic geographically separates these two countries, digitality reduces this natural border; thereby, we could see a budding demonstration of our thesis! Football generates a relationship because Italians and Argentines actively participate in channels that do not limit their geographical borders.
  - ![GRAFICO](path/to/grafico.png)
- To explore whether our intuition was true in this "digital pub", Twitch, we decided to perform two analyses: sentiment analysis and social network analysis.
