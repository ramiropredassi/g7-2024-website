# Sentiments & Emotions {#hide-sentiments-emotions}

## Have you ever wondered how the tone of the football community to which you belong is? So do we! 
 - We looked at the frequency of words with which football comments are spread. We were amazed to see that the most common words are:

##### Sentiment by channel

Apart from exploring what individual people think, we wanted to explore their interactions to see if communities are also created (or divided) around football in the digital world!<br>
##### We used **_Pysentimiento,_** which allowed us to analyse without the limitation of language; it is wonderful that communities can be united despite speaking different languages!

      Since we have six emotions for the Spanish language and four for the Italian, we plot the results into two different graphs.

    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-danger">
      In contrast, the following channels tend to show higher "anger" levels: Controcalcio, HouseofCalcio, Juventibus, TeladoioTokyo, and TVPlay.

    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-success">

### This brings us back to our initial question: Does football unite or divide? <br> This is why we wanted to deepen our analysis by identifying "friendly" or "enemy" communities within the channels. <br> Are you also curious to discover what we found?
